    <p><em><u>Happy and healthful customers! - A blog post by Julie Smith</u></em>

    <p id="doggy">Hi! My name is Julie Smith. I am so happy with healthful. It got me to get up and out of my seat to workout and eat healthy. Before I tried Healthful, I was 200 lbs. over weight. I had lots of health problems and I was super sick. I despised spinach and kale and all things green. Now, 365 days after my healthful journey, I'm really glad that I worked out and ate healthy for once! Thanks, Healthful.</p> 



     <p>I absolutely loved Healthful! It helped me improve my workouts and just my health overall.</p>
         
    <p>---Thank you, Healthful!</p>
