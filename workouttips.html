  <p>For many, starting a regular exercise routine may seem like a scary task. Here are some tips on how to get off on the right foot:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start Small-Pushing yourself beyond your limit right off the bat will lead to a fast failure. Yoga, for example, is a great way to start off getting into a habit of exercising. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYKMP6rOE">Here is an easy yoga routine for beginners.</a></li>
    <li>Build a Routine-Make working out a weekly habit. It may seem like an impossible task to some, but working out for 3-4 days a week, at least 30 minutes a session, is essential for beginner success.</li>
    <li>Diet, diet, diet-Diets are not all just eating celery sticks and drinking lemon water. Sometimes a diet may be reducing the amount of times you eat out a week or how much fat you incorporate into your meals. A good start is reducing the amount of PROCESSED food in your diet.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/processed-foods-to-avoid#2">

    <li>Ask Questions-As a beginner in anything, you are bound to have questions. Do not be afraid to reach out to more experienced people or post in online forums. Collaboration is a great way to share ideas and be successful together by being held accountable. Reach out to your local gym - there are trainers and coaches that could advise you toward the best workout program for you.</li>
